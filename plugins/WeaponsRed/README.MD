# Weapons Red  

## Usage  

Allows admins to prohibit players from using firearms. Only melee weapons and some utility grenades such as smokes or decoys are available.  

## Commands  

`sm_red <target>` Removes player weapons  
`sm_blu <target>` Adds player weapons back **They don't receive their weapons back they will be just allowed to use firearms again**

## Note  

This plugin only works for **Counter Strike Global Offensive** and **Insurgency**  
This plugin is a bit mod specific but I'll release an experimental version that supports all games sometime in the future but if you have a game-specific request shoot me a message and I'll look into it.
