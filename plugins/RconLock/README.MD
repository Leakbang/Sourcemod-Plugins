# Rcon Lock  

## Usage  

 This plugin randomly generates a password every 5 seconds and resets the rcon password. This plugin is very useful for server admins that want to make sure only authorized people can access the rcon. After the plugin is activated users can access the rcon with the `sm_rcon <command>` command.  

## Convars  

`sm_rconlock` Use values 1/0 to enable or disable the rcon lock on the server. Default value: `1`  
`sm_enablercondebug` Use values 1/0 to enable debug messages on this server. Default value: `0` **The debug messages are send to the server console**
